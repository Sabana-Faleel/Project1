<p>The business was founded by Mohit Dubey along with his friends Gaurav, Tufail, and Arun back in October 2005. They planned to put forward numerous initiatives for Indian car consumers. To start up the business, they collected money from friends, family, and even wealthy neighbors. In 2006, they commenced the Used Car Price Guide, which contained all details about a car that would help the customer to determine what would be the actual market value of the vehicle. CarWale made sure that the customers had the most satisfactory experience.</p>
<br>
<p>Car Wale was the first of its kind enterprise in India to do so. The buyers could know details like the car’s model, mileage, age, condition, city, etc. They could also see whether they were doing business with an individual or a dealer, and this provides credibility and transparency. They give information on on-road prices from 200 towns and cities and for all prominent car sales In India since 1991. All these features have made CarWale the most trusted online car dealers in India today. The headquarters of CarWale is in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.
